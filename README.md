# Food Product Explorer - Methodology & Implementation

## Problem Statement
Build a comprehensive web application that allows users to explore food products using the OpenFoodFacts API. The application needed to provide search functionality, filtering capabilities, sorting options and detailed product information while maintaining a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Solution Approach
### 1. Architecture Decision

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js with Vite
- **Styling**: CSS3 with responsive design principles
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state management
- **API Integration**: Fetch API with custom hooks for data management

**Rationale**: React with Vite provides fast development experience and optimal build performance. Context API offers sufficient state management for the application's complexity without the overhead of Redux.

### 2. API Integration Strategy

**OpenFoodFacts API Endpoints Utilized:**
```javascript
// Base URL: https://world.openfoodfacts.org/
- Product search by name: /cgi/search.pl?search_terms={name}&json=true
- Product details by barcode: /api/v0/product/{barcode}.json
- Category-based filtering: /category/{category}.json
```

**Implementation Method:**
- Created custom hooks (`useProducts`, `useProductDetails`) for API calls
- Implemented error handling and loading states
- Added request debouncing for search functionality to optimize API calls
- Cached frequently requested data to reduce API load

### 3. Feature Implementation Methodology

#### A. Homepage & Product Display
- Implemented virtual scrolling/pagination to handle large product lists
- Used lazy loading for product images
- Created reusable ProductCard components with optimized rendering

#### B. Search Functionality
1. **Name-based Search**: 
   - Debounced input to prevent excessive API calls
   - Real-time filtering with loading indicators
2. **Barcode Search**: 
   - Separate input field with validation for barcode format
   - Direct API call to specific product endpoint

#### C. Category Filtering
- Fetched available categories from OpenFoodFacts API
- Implemented dropdown filter with dynamic category loading
- Combined with search functionality for refined results

#### D. Sorting Mechanism
**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Sorting options implemented:
- Product name (A-Z, Z-A)
- Nutrition grade (A-E, E-A)
- Custom sorting logic for handling missing data
```

#### E. Product Detail Page

- React Router for navigation
- Comprehensive product information display
- Conditional rendering for missing data fields
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
### 5. State Management Strategy

**Context API Implementation:**
```javascript
// Global states managed:
- Product list and search results
- Active filters and sorting preferences
- Loading states and error handling
- User preferences (theme, view mode)
```

**Rationale**: Context API provided sufficient complexity management without Redux overhead, keeping the codebase simpler and more maintainable.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Component Architecture
- **Atomic Design**: Breaking UI into small, reusable components
- **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Separating logic from presentation
- **Custom Hooks**: Abstracting API logic and state management

### 2. Data Flow
- Unidirectional data flow using Context API
- Props drilling minimized through context providers
- Local state for component-specific data

### 3. Styling Approach
- CSS Modules for component isolation
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Consistent design system with CSS custom properties
